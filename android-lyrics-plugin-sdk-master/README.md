OVERVIEW
###############

This SDK allows you to use the Lyrics Plugin App (currently in beta) from within your own application.
If you have built a music application, you can just link the sdk as explained here and, when you want to display the lyrics, just make a call to our plugin through the connector class. 

###############
USAGE
###############

The integration steps are minimal:

- integrate the lyrics button as in the "musiXmatchSDKActivity.java"

- enable the testMode while integrating your application

- accept musiXmatch terms of service (registering as a developer and notifying us your intention of use)

- wait for the approval before publishing or distributing the application in any form

- disable the testMode before publishing it
